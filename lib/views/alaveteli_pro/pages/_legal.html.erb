  <p>
    You can terminate this agreement at any time and for any reason by ceasing
    use of AsktheEU Pro and cancelling any subscription you have.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have a paid subscription, cancellations are applied at the end of
    the current billing period. Until that date you will continue to have full

    <li>
      You won't be able to access AsktheEU Pro tools, including the dashboard
      and pro request management.
    </li>

    <li>
      You will still be able to see any requests which are currently private,
      but you won't be able to make new private requests or extend privacy
      durations. These requests will be published when the current privacy
      period ends.
    </li>

    <li>
      You can re-subscribe at any time and full access to these features will
      be restored.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Access Info Europe may suspend your access to AsktheEU Pro if:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You have failed to make any payment due;

    <li>
      Access Info Europe reasonably believes you to be in material breach of
      any term of this agreement;
    </li>

      Access Info Europe reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so in
      order to comply with any applicable law or the order of a court or other

    These Terms are subject to the law of Spain. They constitute all the terms
    and conditions agreed upon between you and Access Info Europe and supersede
    any prior agreements, whether written or oral.
  </p>

  <p>
    You expressly understand and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by
    law, Access Info Europe excludes all liability and responsibility to you
    for any loss or damage resulting, directly or indirectly, from your use of
    or inability to use AsktheEU Pro. In any event, our total liability for all
    claims made about AsktheEU Pro in any month will be no more than the amount
    which you paid us for the Service the previous month.
  </p>

  <p>
    Access Info Europe shall not be deemed to have waived its right to enforce
    any of its rights under this agreement merely because it has previously
    failed to enforce its rights under this agreement, or permitted you to
    breach any term of this agreement on one or more occasions.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a court, or other competent authority, finds that any term of this
    agreement is illegal or otherwise unenforceable, that term is to be treated
    as if it had been severed from this agreement. Its severance will be
    treated (as far as possible) as having no effect on the remainder of this
    agreement.
